# Codecademy project: Photo Caption Contest

**The "Photo Caption Contest" project is a component of the Codecademy Back-End Engineer course.**

>The project involves creating a backend for a photo caption contest platform. The server will host images and have endpoints for user authentication and authorization. Users will need to be signed in to create a caption, and a database schema using PostgreSQL and ORM sequelize will be created to store user and caption information. Endpoints will be tested using Postman, and a localized cache will be used to optimize performance. Swagger will be used to write the documentation, and the project will be deployed on Heroku.

## Project Objectives:
- Use Git version control
- Create documentation using the Swagger API
- Implement a database
- Integrate existing API endpoints with database layer
- Database implementation for transactions
- Deploy app using Heroku

## Prerequisites:
- Command line and file navigation
